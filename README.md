# General Info
Very basic and lightweight audio player. This is not anything that is supposed to replace your current audio player, neither it looks too good, but it works and was enough for me as this is a learning project. The software is open source and feel free to improve it or copy code from it as long as you credit me.

# Setup
## Portable version
Extract the folder somewhere and double click on "Sharp Player.exe" to run it.
## Installer
Run the installer and follow the steps, the installer is made with visual studio using the official installer extension.

# Functionalities
* Play sound files.
* Select a certain folder, gets the music from the folder and play it as a playlist.
* Add sound files from different locations and add them to the playlist.
* Volume, back and forward, pause, stop and play controls.
* Repeat ability with 3 stages: no, current playlist, current track.

# Project status
Will probably not get any new feature updates in the near future, maybe some bugfiex tho, but who knows maybe one day i will continue it.
